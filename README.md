  # Sensei
  Sensei is a mentorship platform that allows high school students to match with mentors to get help and guidance from students who have been in their positions.

# Quick links

Would be badges that link to different parts of the readme


# Features
- Mentor matching
- Scholarship finder
- College Application Assistance
- Resource Library
- A chatbot

#  MVP
The minimum viable product will only have the mentor matching platform, allowing us to match high school students with college students. This will be the only functional part of the project. The rest—the scholarship finder, college application assistance, and resource library—will be showcased on the website but not fully developed.
