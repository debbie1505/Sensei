# Sensei
Sensei is a mentorship platform that allows high school students to match with mentors, creating a mentor-mentee relationship. In this case, the mentors are college students who are trained and well-equipped to be mentors. The idea behind this is that high school students can get help from mentors who have been in their positions and understand what they are going through. The mentee and the mentor would have meetings that fit both of their schedules, during which the mentee could ask for help from the mentor. 

# Features
- Mentor matching
- Scholarship finder
- College Application Assistance
- Resource Library
- A chatbot

#  MVP
The minimum viable product will only have the mentor matching platform, which will allow us to match high school students with college students. This will be the only functional part of the project. The rest—the scholarship finder, college application assistance, and resource library—will be showcased on the website but not fully developed.
