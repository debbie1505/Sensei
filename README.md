# Sensei
Sensei is a mentorship platform that allows high school students to match with mentors to get help and guidance from students who have been in their positions. 

# Features
- Mentor matching
- Scholarship finder
- College Application Assistance
- Resource Library
- A chatbot

#  MVP
The minimum viable product will only have the mentor matching platform, allowing us to match high school students with college students. This will be the only functional part of the project. The rest—the scholarship finder, college application assistance, and resource library—will be showcased on the website but not fully developed.
